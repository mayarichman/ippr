            <h1>An investigative platform for advocacy</h1>


            <p>Transparent Oil Namibia enables you to map, find, browse, and search petroleum exploration licences. You can find which companies hold licences, who owns and manages these companies, where they’re registered, and how ownership has changed over time. You can also access licence and company information by clicking on the map.</p>

            <p>The information on this platform is publicly available, but it was previously hard to access and use for advocacy without exhausting resources. Tracking licence history in Namibia has often required sorting through hundreds of hardcopy pages of text. With improved accessibility to this data, you can more easily combat industry corruption and advocate for policy changes in Namibia.</p>

            <blockquote>
                “Such negative outcomes of resource extraction, commonly known as the resource curse.. can be countered by strong and unambiguous policies, accompanied by effective institutional structures.“ <a href="http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=139106&page=archive-read">- The Namibian</a>
            </blockquote>

            <p>With a small group of public officials exercising discretionary decision-making powers, the current way petroleum exploration licences in Namibia are issued is opaque and open to abuse. Politically-connected owners receive concession rights which they can then sell at a higher price for their financial gain.</p>

            <p>IPPR developed this platform to identify licencing patterns, red-flag corruption, and advocate for policy reform.</p>
